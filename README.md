# Copy Relative URL

This is a very simple firefox extension to add a "Copy URL Path" option to the context menu when you right click a link. If you right click a link and the URL is https://dev.example.com/some-path/?q=1#hash, it will copy /some-path/?q=1#hash to your clipboard.

### Why does this exist?

I'm a web developer and I sometimes have to copy only that part of a URL. An example would be if I'm working on a site called dev.example.com but I'm copy/pasting something that will run on example.com, I just want the relative URL. Niche! Will it save me that much time? Well, it turned out, one of the examples in Firefox's extension developer tutorial was how to add a context menu item in the context of a link and then add it to the clipboard. So, my contribution was like 5 lines of code and finding an open source icon.
